<h1>Learn to Code (Build a Webpage)</h1>
<h2>Steps To Take Before The Meetup</h2>

You will need a GitHub account. If you don't have one already, sign up for one:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a><br/>
<br/>

Your GitHub username will be part of the URL of your webpage, and you'll be eventually using your GitHub profile as a way to show your work to potential employers, so choose your username carefully.<br/>
<br/>

Download and install a text editor. Personally, I like Atom:<br/>
<a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io/</a><br/>
<br/>
But if you run into issues installing Atom, or already have another editor that you prefer, any of these will work:
<br/>
<a href="http://brackets.io/">http://brackets.io/</a><br/>
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a><br/>
<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a> (this is a good choice for Windows users)<br/>
<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">https://www.sublimetext.com/</a> (this one has an occasional nag screen wanting you to pay for it, but you can just cancel out of it when it comes up)
<br/>
<br/>

Download and install GitHub Desktop (Windows or Mac):<br/>
<a href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a><br/>
<br/>

If you run into issues installing GitHub Desktop on Windows, or you'd just prefer to use Git from the command line and follow along with the command line instructions during the Meetup, there's another option. You can install this instead, keeping the default settings checked during the install process:<br/>
<a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io">https://git-for-windows.github.io</a><br/>
<br/>
Note that using Git from the command line is far less friendly to beginners and requires more steps to get the same things done--but we will be coming around to assist each person regardless of their setup.
<br/><br/>
Once you have these set up, you should be ready to follow along with the session during the meetup!
