Download and install GitHub Desktop (Windows or Mac):<br/>

<br/>

The free website hosting service offered through GitHub is called Github Pages. They have step by step instructions for how to use it on their homepage:<br/>
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a><br/>
<br/>

For the step between 1 and 2, choose "GitHub for Windows" or "GitHub for Mac" depending on which OS you're using. If you're using Linux, you should be able to choose "Terminal" and follow along that way.<br/>
<br/>

You will need to create a new repository (which is like a project) in your GitHub account, following a specific naming convention. If your username is "meetupgoer", the repository name would be: meetupgoer.github.io<br/>
<br/>

Essentially, you'll be doing what I did during the presentation: cloning your new project to a folder on your computer, creating a new file inside that folder, adding some HTML content to it, committing the file, and pushing it to GitHub.<br/>
<br/>

Here's a walkthrough on how to commit and push changes using GitHub desktop (they seem to use a "Sync" button for this):<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project/">https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project/</a><br/>
<br/>

After you push (or use the "sync" button), you should be able to go to yourusername.github.io in your browser and see the webpage. From there, every time you make a change to the site on your computer, you have to commit and push (sync) again for the changes to be published to GitHub Pages. In fact, GitHub Desktop seems to be smart about the fact that it's a GitHub Pages project, and it seems to actually give you a "Publish" button instead of a "Sync" button.<br/>
<br/>

You can actually do File -> Open in your browser and open up the index.html file, to check out what your page will look like on your local computer, before you publish it out to GitHub and the public internet. That way, as you get further along into HTML and trying new things out on your page, you can keep refreshing in the browser until you've got it working the way you want. You don't have to commit and push (sync/publish) until you're ready to go live with the changes.
